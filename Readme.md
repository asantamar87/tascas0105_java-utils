# Java Utils Exercises

This repository contains Java utility exercises focused on file and directory operations, serialization, and text file handling.

## Level 1

### Exercise 1
Create a class that lists the contents of a directory received as a parameter in alphabetical order.

### Exercise 2
Enhance the class from the previous exercise by adding the functionality to list a directory tree recursively. The output should display the contents of all levels in alphabetical order within each level, indicating whether each entry is a directory (D) or a file (F), along with its last modification date.

### Exercise 3
Modify the previous exercise so that, instead of displaying the output on the screen, the results are saved to a TXT file.

### Exercise 4
Add the functionality to read any TXT file and display its content in the console.

### Exercise 5
The program should now serialize a Java object into a `.ser` file and then deserialize it.

## Requirements
- Java 8 or higher
- File handling knowledge
- Basic understanding of serialization in Java
